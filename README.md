# Student Grade Predictor

This simple Python project demonstrates how to predict a student's final grade in a Numerical Analysis course using linear regression.

## Features Used
- GPA
- Average of prerequisite course grades
- Attendance in early weeks
- Quiz 1 performance

## Output
- Predicted final grade
- 95% confidence interval for the predicted grade
- Standard error of the model
- Confidence percentage that the true grade falls within Â±1 of the prediction

## Libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

## How to Run
